# Multi-Table Synthetic data generation

**Multi-Table or Database's synthetic data generation** is a powerful method to create high-quality artificial datasets
that mirror the statistical properties and relational structures of original multi-table databases. 
A multi-table database consists of multiple interrelated tables, often with various data types (dates, categorical, numerical, etc.) 
and complex relationships between records.
Key use cases include privacy-preserving access to full production databases and the creation of realistic test environments. 
Synthetic data allows organizations to share and analyze full production databases without exposing sensitive information, 
ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. Additionally, it is invaluable for creating realistic test environments, 
enabling developers and testers to simulate real-world scenarios, identify potential issues, and validate database applications 
without risking data breaches.
By leveraging synthetic multi-table data, organizations can simulate complex relational data environments, enhance the robustness 
of database applications, and ensure data privacy, making it a valuable tool for industries that rely on intricate data structures 
and interdependencies.
