## Overview

The *YData SDK* is an ecosystem of methods that allows users to, through a python interface, adopt a *Data-Centric* approach towards the AI development. The solution includes a set of integrated components for data ingestion, standardized data quality evaluation and data improvement, such as *synthetic data generation*, allowing an iterative improvement of the datasets used in high-impact business applications.

**Synthetic data** can be used as Machine Learning performance enhancer, to augment or mitigate the presence of bias in real data. Furthermore, it can be used as a Privacy Enhancing Technology, to enable data-sharing initiatives or even to fuel testing environments. 

Under the YData-SDK hood, you can find a set of algorithms and metrics based on statistics and deep learning based techniques, that will help you to accelerate your data preparation. 

## Current functionality

YData SDK is currently composed by the following main modules:

* **Datasources**

* **Synthesizers**

* **Synthetic data quality report**

* **Profiling**
